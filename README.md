# EZ STREAM
## Goal
Create a web application that searches for movie and show titles and displays a results list that matches the user input. The user can then select a specific title and be taken to a results page which will highlight more information on that title. It will then provide a list the streaming services that the title is available on for the user and update the recent search result list for future reference.
## Application
#### Highlights
1. When the search input is submitted, a results list will generate that matches the input description.
2. When the user selects a specific title, they will get taken to a results page that has a description of the title and a list of the available streaming services it can be found on.
3. Once the user selects a title, that choice will get appended to the recent searches footer for future reference.
4. The recent searches will be saved into local storage so that when the user refreshes the page, the recent searches will provide a reference point.
